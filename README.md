Urban design today faces a critical challenge: the absence of systematic and transparent methodologies that can be rigorously tested and validated. Traditional urban planning often falls short of addressing the complexities of modern cities. This mini-thesis aims to fill this gap by developing a 5D walkability indices tool that integrates urban morphology with accessibility to amenities, conceptualized as Human Activities Measurements. The goal is to create a comprehensive tool that assesses walkability by considering  urban form and human activity patterns, crucial for designing livable and walkable neighborhoods.

Walkability is a key factor in urban quality of life, directly influencing mobility, social interaction, and access to services. Understanding human behavior and preferences is essential to crafting neighborhoods that promote walking and sustainable urban living. Our tool provides a multi-dimensional assessment that considers not only the city's physical structure but also access to everyday amenities like shops, parks, and public transit. This holistic approach ensures a more accurate reflection of real-world walkability.

We apply this tool to Copenhagen, particularly focusing on Jernbanebyen, a developing area with significant urban proposals from firms such as COBE, BIG, and Snohetta. These proposals are evaluated in the context of surrounding urban morphology and human activity measurements. Our system generates quantifiable walkability metrics that architects and planners can use to refine their designs. This creates a feedback loop, allowing for iterative improvements in walkability based on data-driven insights. The tool’s ability to benchmark designs in real time offers invaluable feedback during the design process.

The tool is deployed online using the Mapbox API, enhancing its usability through interactive spatial visualizations. Users can explore different scenarios, evaluate walkability scores, and understand the impact of urban form on human behavior. This online platform serves as a resource for professionals and a way to engage the public in urban design. It provides a user-friendly interface where changes in design can be visualized and analyzed in terms of their effect on walkability.

By combining quantitative analysis with visual interactivity, this project offers a systematic and transparent methodology for assessing urban walkability. This contributes to urban design by providing a rigorous, testable tool that can be validated and applied in various contexts. The tool’s integration of human behavior and urban form into walkability assessments ensures that designs align with the needs and preferences of city residents.

In conclusion, this 5D walkability tool not only advances urban design practice but also provides a critical resource for ensuring future developments prioritize walkability. Its application in Copenhagen showcases its potential as a valuable tool for architects and urban planners, offering data-driven insights to create cities that are more accessible, functional, and aligned with the ways people live and move.
